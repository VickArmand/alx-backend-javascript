/**
 * Import Car from 10-car.js.
 * Implement a class named EVCar that extends the Car class:
 * Constructor attributes:brand (String), motor (String), color (String), range (String)
 * Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
 * For privacy reasons, when cloneCar is called on a EVCar object,
 * the object returned should be an instance of Car instead of EVCar.
